# Projects Created and A simple description

1. Ask Librarian
- My final year project during my studies at the University of Leicester. It is a chatbot based on Google's Vertext AI and it is utilizing Dialogflow CX for the AI. The folder contains the files that makes up the website that holds the chatbot, the exported files from Dialogflow CX and my dissertation. Unfortunately, the project and database for the chatbot is closed, as such the chatbot does not work at the moment. In the dissertation, there are examples of the chatbot's workflow.

2. Big Data Project
- An incomplete group project during the Data Analysis module. Due to multiple issues, the project was not completed but the project does showcase my ability to read and clean large data files and analyse the data to a certain degree. In terms of my participation in the group project, I did 50-60% of the work. After learning more regarding data analytics, I would like to come back to this project and complete it.
