For the parsing assignment (assignment 3), I am using Python. I am using the xml.etree.ElementTree and json imports.
xml.etree.ElementTree is used to parse the xml.
json is used to transform the dictionary(parsed data) into a valid json format file.
Both imports are built-in python libraries.

How to use:
1) Run the program
2) It will generate a file called "result.json". The final json output is in the file
3) The file already has the result.json file just in case there are any issues. Please delete/move the file to check if the code is running properly.

There are sufficient comments in the code.
